# Moonlight-uwp csharp-only branch 

Moonlight-Windows client RnD

## About the original
Moonlight-Windows is the (a) famous "Video Screen streaming service". 
Sadly, W10M-related Moonlight-Windows branch was cancelled/archived... 
No new features... I am interesting in NVidea-like game streaming tech. :)

## My 2 cents
- Moonlight Micro-RnD (Fast code/architecture research)
- Moonlight-common-binding C++ -> C# code "rebase" ("refactor.") - 5 % ready  

## Result
- Draft / Damaged
- I haven't much time... but I'm still trying to complete my strange "Moonlight uwp reburn" idea

## Servers
To make Moonlight-uwp test&work, you need a Server, you can use one of the following ones:

- Sunshine. The recommended open source solution (https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine). Instead of NVidea things, it compatible with Windows/macOS/Linix and with any GPU.

As is. No support. RnD only. DIY
